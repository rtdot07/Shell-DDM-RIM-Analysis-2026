# Shell-PLC-Equity-Valuation-Analysis (Financial Modelling & Projections till 2031)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive equity valuation of Shell PLC using two fundamental valuation techniques: the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Residual Income Model (RIM). This analysis projects financial performance through 2031 to determine if the stock is currently undervalued or overvalued in the market.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Analysis Questions
•	How has revenue growth translated into sustainable net income over time, and where does profitability normalize in the forecast period?
•	What explains the sharp inflection in residual income during the early forecast years, and how does it stabilize in the long run?
• How does EBIT margin evolution support (or constrain) future residual income generation?
• To what extent is the firm’s total implied value driven by existing book value versus future earnings power?
• Does the valuation rely more heavily on near-term performance or long-term residual income growth, and what does this imply about execution risk?
• How sensitive is the implied firm value to margin compression or revenue slowdown in the outer years of the forecast?
• What margin level appears to be the steady-state assumption, and is it conservative relative to historical peaks?
• How much upside does the residual income model suggest relative to the current market price, and what market expectations might explain the gap?
• Does the model indicate that the market is undervaluing future excess returns on equity, despite positive residual income generation?
• From a long-term investor perspective, does value creation stem more from reinvestment efficiency or balance-sheet strength?
