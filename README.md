# Shell-PLC-Equity-Valuation-Analysis (Financial Modelling & Projections till 2031)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive equity valuation of Shell PLC using two fundamental valuation techniques: the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Residual Income Model (RIM). This analysis projects financial performance through 2031 to determine if the stock is currently undervalued or overvalued in the market.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Analysis Questions

•	How has revenue growth translated into sustainable net income over time, and where does profitability normalize in the forecast period?

•	What explains the sharp inflection in residual income during the early forecast years, and how does it stabilize in the long run?

• How does EBIT margin evolution support (or constrain) future residual income generation?

• To what extent is the firm’s total implied value driven by existing book value versus future earnings power?

• Does the valuation rely more heavily on near-term performance or long-term residual income growth, and what does this imply about execution risk?

• How sensitive is the implied firm value to margin compression or revenue slowdown in the outer years of the forecast?

• What margin level appears to be the steady-state assumption, and is it conservative relative to historical peaks?

• How much upside does the residual income model suggest relative to the current market price, and what market expectations might explain the gap?

• Does the model indicate that the market is undervaluing future excess returns on equity, despite positive residual income generation?

• From a long-term investor perspective, does value creation stem more from reinvestment efficiency or balance-sheet strength?

## Process
•	Data Extraction: Compiled historical data (2020-2024) for Revenue, EBIT, Net Income, and Dividends.
•	Projection Modelling: Forecasted financial statements through 2031 based on estimated EBIT margins (~11%) and steady-state terminal growth (~4%).
•	Capital Charge Calculation: Applied a 9% cost of equity to the Capital Employed to determine economic profit.
•	Model Integration: Built a dynamic valuation dashboard that calculates the Present Value (PV) of future cash flows and residual income.

## Project Insights
•	Economic Value Add: Shell is projected to generate positive Residual Income consistently through 2031, with a terminal value estimated at $61.97B.
•	Margin Stability: EBIT margins are expected to stabilize around 11.05% by 2031, down from the 2022 high of 17.61%.
•	Equity Cushion: The firm maintains a strong Book Value of Equity (~$133.73B), providing a significant margin of safety for investors.
•	Discount to Intrinsic Value: The current market price of $27.05 represents a significant discount compared to the model's implied price of $35.88.

## Final Conclusion:
To capitalize on current market inefficiencies, a BUY rating is recommended for Shell PLC at its current price of 20.29 GBP ($27.05 equivalent). The Residual Income Model yields an implied price of 26.91 GBP ($35.88), representing a significant 32.6% potential upside. This valuation is anchored by a robust Book Value of Equity ($133.73B) and consistent projected economic profits through 2031, suggesting that the firm is trading well below its fundamental earning power in both USD and GBP terms
